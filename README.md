# Email-Spam-Detection
 Email spam detection uses machine learning to classify emails as spam or not. By using algorithms like Naive Bayes or SVM and features like word frequency, subject lines, and sender info, Python libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, NLTK) help build models that filter unwanted emails and improve inbox security.
